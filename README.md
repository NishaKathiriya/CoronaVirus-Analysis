# Coronavirus Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic data using SQL. The goal is to derive meaningful insights into the spread and impact of the virus based on the dataset provided.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Province**: Geographic subdivision within a country/region.
- **Country/Region**: Geographic entity where data is recorded.
- **Latitude**: North-south position on Earth's surface.
- **Longitude**: East-west position on Earth's surface.
- **Date**: Recorded date of Coronavirus data.
- **Confirmed**: Number of diagnosed Coronavirus cases.
- **Deaths**: Number of Coronavirus-related deaths.
- **Recovered**: Number of recovered Coronavirus cases.

## Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to perform detailed analysis on the Coronavirus dataset to answer the following questions:
1. Total number of confirmed cases globally.
2. Total number of deaths globally.
3. Total number of recoveries globally.
4. Number of confirmed cases by country.
5. Number of deaths by country.
6. Number of recoveries by country.
7. Number of confirmed cases over time.
8. Number of deaths over time.
9. Number of recoveries over time.
10. Number of confirmed cases by province.
11. Number of deaths by province.
12. Number of recoveries by province.
13. Country with the highest number of confirmed cases.
14. Country with the highest number of deaths.
15. Country with the highest number of recoveries.
16. Impact of latitude and longitude on the spread of the virus.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **SQL**: Basic to intermediate knowledge of SQL.
- **Database Management System**: Any SQL-based DBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

### Installation
 **Set Up the Database**
   - Load the dataset into your SQL database.
   - Ensure the database schema matches the dataset structure.

## Results and Insights
The analysis provided several key insights into the spread and impact of the Coronavirus. Here are some highlights:
- **Global Impact**: The total number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries globally.
- **Country-wise Analysis**: Identified countries with the highest number of cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- **Temporal Trends**: Observed trends over time for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- **Geographic Insights**: Impact of geographic factors (latitude and longitude) on the spread of the virus.

## Visualizations
Visualizations can be added to enhance the presentation of results. Tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Tableau can be used for this purpose.
